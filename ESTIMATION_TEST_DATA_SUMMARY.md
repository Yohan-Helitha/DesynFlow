## Key Features for Testing

### 1. Projects Without Estimates (4 projects)
Test creating first estimation for these projects:
- Projects 1-4 have `estimateCreated: false`
- Can test `getProjectsWithInspections()` endpoint

### 2. Pending Estimations (4 projects)
Test approval/rejection workflow:
- Can approve to generate quotations
- Can reject to request revision
- Can update costs and re-submit

### 3. Approved Estimations (7 projects)
Test quotation generation:
- Can create detailed quotations
- Can add labor/material line items
- Can calculate taxes and contingencies
- Can send to clients

### 4. Versioning Workflow
Test creating new versions:
- Update estimation costs
- Create version 2 with changes
- Track estimation history
- Link quotations to specific versions

### 5. Cost Calculations
Test auto-calculation:
- Update labor cost ‚Üí verify total updates
- Update material cost ‚Üí verify total updates
- Add service/contingency ‚Üí verify percentages
- Validation rules for minimum costs

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Run the seed script**: `node server/seed/seedEstimationData.js`
2. **Verify data in database**: Check MongoDB collections
3. **Test API endpoints**: Use Postman/Thunder Client
4. **Test UI flows**: Login and navigate estimation pages
5. **Test versioning**: Create v2, v3 estimations
6. **Test quotations**: Generate PDFs and send to clients

## Notes
- All estimations use Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR)
- Realistic construction industry data
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Ready for comprehensive workflow testing
- Covers all estimation statuses
- Supports multi-version testing
