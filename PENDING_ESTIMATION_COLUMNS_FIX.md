# Pending Estimation Columns Display Fix

## Issue
In the Finance Portal's "Pending Estimations" section, the columns for **Client Name**, **Property Type**, and **Site Location** were showing "N/A" instead of displaying actual data from the inspection records.

## Root Cause
The frontend component (`PendingEstimation.jsx`) was attempting to access inspection data fields, but:
1. The field access patterns were not handling all possible data structures
2. There was no defensive fallback logic
3. The code wasn't extracting data from the `inspectionId` object properly

## Backend Data Structure
The backend endpoint `/api/project-estimation/projects-with-inspections` returns projects with populated `inspectionId` containing:
- `client_name` (or `email` as fallback)
- `propertyType`
- `siteLocation` (computed field)
- `propertyLocation_address`
- `propertyLocation_city`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Console Logging for Debugging
Added console.log statements to inspect the actual data structure returned by the API:
```javascript
console.log('Fetched projects:', data);
if (data.length > 0) {
  console.log('First project structure:', data[0]);
  console.log('First project inspectionId:', data[0].inspectionId);
}
```

### 2. Created Helper Variables in Table Rendering
Instead of inline conditionals, extracted data using helper variables with proper fallbacks:
```javascript
const inspection = project.inspectionId || {};
const clientName = inspection.client_name || inspection.clientName || inspection.email || 'N/A';
const propertyType = inspection.propertyType || 'N/A';
const siteLocation = inspection.siteLocation || 
  (inspection.propertyLocation_address || inspection.propertyLocation_city
    ? `${inspection.propertyLocation_address || ''}${inspection.propertyLocation_city ? (inspection.propertyLocation_address ? ', ' : '') + inspection.propertyLocation_city : ''}`
    : 'N/A');
```

### 3. Updated Filter Logic
Modified the `filteredProjects` filtering to use the same extraction pattern:
```javascript
const inspection = project.inspectionId || {};
const clientName = inspection.client_name || inspection.clientName || inspection.email || '';
const propertyType = inspection.propertyType || '';
const siteLocation = inspection.siteLocation || 
  `${inspection.propertyLocation_address || ''} ${inspection.propertyLocation_city || ''}`;
```

### 4. Fixed Sort Field Name
Changed sort field from `'inspectionId.clientName'` to `'inspectionId.client_name'` to match backend field naming:
```javascript
onClick={() => handleSort('inspectionId.client_name')}
```

## Changes Made

### File: `frontend/staff-dashboard/src/finance-portal/components/EstimationsSection/PendingEstimation.jsx`

**Lines Modified:**
- Lines 18-36: Added debugging console logs in `fetchProjectsWithInspections`
- Lines 58-70: Updated filter logic with defensive data extraction
- Lines 185: Fixed sort field name from `clientName` to `client_name`
- Lines 234-264: Refactored table body rendering with helper variables

## Key Improvements

1. **Defensive Data Access**: All field accesses now have proper fallback chains
2. **Consistent Extraction**: Same helper pattern used in both filtering and rendering
3. **Better Debugging**: Console logs help identify data structure issues
4. **Field Name Accuracy**: Sort field now matches backend field naming convention
5. **Cleaner Code**: Helper variables make the rendering logic more readable and maintainable

## Testing Checklist

- [x] No syntax errors in PendingEstimation.jsx
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Client Name column displays actual client names or emails
- [ ] Property Type column displays property types from inspection data
- [ ] Site Location column displays formatted addresses
- [ ] Search functionality works with client names, property types, and locations
- [ ] Sorting by Client Name works correctly
- [ ] Console logs show correct data structure in browser dev tools

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Client Name**: Should display `client_name` field, falling back to `email` if name is unavailable
2. **Property Type**: Should display the property type from the inspection (e.g., "Residential", "Commercial")
3. **Site Location**: Should display formatted address like "123 Main St, Colombo" or individual components

## Debug Steps

If columns still show "N/A":
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for the logged project structure
4. Verify that `inspectionId` object exists and contains the expected fields
5. Check if field names match exactly (case-sensitive)
