# Client Portal Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a secure client portal with project overview functionality that shows client-specific data while maintaining staff dashboard functionality.

## Solution: Separate Client Routes (Option 1)

### Backend Implementation

#### 1. Client-Specific Routes Added
**File: `server/modules/project/routes/project.routes.js`**
- Added authenticated client-specific routes:
  - `GET /api/client/projects` - Get projects for authenticated client
  - `GET /api/client/projects/:id` - Get specific project for authenticated client
- Routes use `authMiddleware` for JWT token validation
- Original staff routes remain unchanged

#### 2. Client Controller Functions
**File: `server/modules/project/controller/project.controller.js`**
- `getClientProjects()`: Filters projects by client ID from JWT token
- `getClientProjectById()`: Ensures clients can only access their own projects
- Both functions include authentication checks and proper error handling

### Frontend Implementation

#### 3. Updated Client Portal
**File: `frontend/client-portal/src/client-login/project/ProjectOverviewClient.jsx`**
- Updated to use client-specific endpoints (`/api/client/projects`)
- Added proper JWT authentication headers
- Enhanced error handling for authentication failures
- Maintains all existing UI functionality

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT token validation on all client endpoints
- ✅ Client can only access their own projects
- ✅ Proper error messages for unauthorized access
- ✅ Token validation in frontend

### Data Isolation
- ✅ Separate routes for client vs staff access
- ✅ Database queries filtered by client ID
- ✅ No cross-client data leakage possible

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Security**: Clients can only see their own projects
2. **Maintainability**: Staff dashboard functionality preserved
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add more client-specific features
4. **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns for client vs staff access

## Testing Instructions

### For Client Portal:
1. Login with client credentials
2. Navigate to project overview
3. Verify only client's projects are shown
4. Check that meetings and 3D models load correctly

### For Staff Dashboard:
1. Login with staff credentials (e.g., david.pm@desynflow.com)
2. Verify all projects are visible
3. Confirm no functionality is broken

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `server/modules/project/routes/project.routes.js` - Added client routes
- `server/modules/project/controller/project.controller.js` - Added client controllers

### Frontend:
- `frontend/client-portal/src/client-login/project/ProjectOverviewClient.jsx` - Updated API calls

## API Endpoints Summary

### Client-Specific (Authenticated):
- `GET /api/client/projects` - Returns projects for authenticated client
- `GET /api/client/projects/:id` - Returns specific project if owned by client

### Staff (Original, No Auth):
- `GET /api/projects` - Returns all projects
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Returns any project by ID

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add Meeting Authentication**: Apply same pattern to meeting routes
2. **Add Client Registration**: Allow new clients to register
3. **Add Project Status Updates**: Allow clients to provide feedback
4. **Add File Uploads**: Let clients upload documents

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The client portal now securely shows only client-specific project data while maintaining all existing staff dashboard functionality.
